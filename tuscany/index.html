<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="photopages/countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="view of the rolling tuscan hills" width="100" height="75"></a> This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>Sienna</h2>
<p><a href="photopages/sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>Bakery</h2>
<p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="view of sweet baked goods" width="75" height="100"></a> While in Sienna, we smelled something amazing in the air. It was the scent of fresh baked pastries! When we went inside the bakery they had many assorted pastries and other baked goods which we were happy to try.</p>

<h2>Cathedral</h2>
<p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="view of the cathedral church" width="75" height="100"></a> The cathedral we saw in town was by far the most beautiful detailed structure we have seen on our trip. Many people were gathered around to partake in its beauty and spirit.</p>

<h2>Flowers</h2>
<p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="view of lavender plants" width="75" height="100"></a> Not only were the buildings beautiful but we saw beautiful plants as well. Gorgeous lavender flowers surrounded the buildings like in this picture. It was a beautiful sight to see.</p>
